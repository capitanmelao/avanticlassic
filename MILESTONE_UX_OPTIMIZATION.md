### üéµ Enhanced Playlist System

**Problem Solved**: Playlists created in admin panel were not displaying on frontend due to API translation query issues.

- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate synchronization between admin panel and frontend

### üé¨ Hero Video Enhancement

**Goal**: Create maximum visual impact with ultra-wide video presentation and clean controls.

#### **Layout Optimization**
- **Width**: Increased from 80% to 97% screen width (only 3% total margin)
- **Responsiveness**: Maintained aspect ratio scaling across devices
- **Visual Impact**: Dramatic full-width presentation while preserving subtle margins

#### **Sound Control Redesign**
- **Icon Replacement**: Replaced ugly emoji icons (üîáüîä) with clean Lucide icons
